\subsubsection{Remaining Systematics [Section to be removed]}
\label{sec:Systematics_Remaining}

{\color{red}
We are continuing work on the remaining systematics with many of them nearing completion. The following is a list of sources of systematic uncertainty separated by relevance to \p0d and Tracker.\\

Remaining \p0d Related Systematics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Track Timing
\item Out of '\p0d Fiducial Volum' Background
\item Physics Parameters
\end{itemize}

Remaining Tracker Related Systematics:
\begin{itemize}
\item TPC1 track reconstruction efficiency
\item Tracker reconstruction efficiency
\item Charge Mis-ID by Global reconstrucoin
\item TPC Measured Momentum
\end{itemize}
