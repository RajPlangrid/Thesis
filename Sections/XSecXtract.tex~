\section{Extracting the Cross Section}
\label{sec:xsec}

In this section, we extract the CC Inclusive cross section from the previously
described selection.

In section [ref], highly pure samples of $\nu_\mu$ induced charged
current inclusive events were selected during water-in and air running
periods of the P0D. In this section, a cross
section on water is extracted by a statistical subtraction of data
from water-in and air configurations.
